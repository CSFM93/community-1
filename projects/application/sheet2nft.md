## Project Description
Sheet2NFT is a no-code tool that I built with the help of Vue, Node.js, Google Sheets, Chainlink, Moralis, IPFS, Web3.Storage, and Filecoin, that allows users to easily create NFTs assets (contract, images URI , metadata URI) without knowing how to code. 
This application does the following :
- uploads the images to IPFS
- generates the metadata file for each image
- inserts the image's URI to the generated metadata
- uploads the generated metadata files to IPFS
- generates an ERC-1155 and adds the metadata URI to it

Sheet2NFT is a project that I built for the Chainlink Fall Hackathon and it is one of the selected Winners of the Chainlink On the Rise prize as well as the IPFS/Filecoin pool prize.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
We are using the Moralis IPFS service to store the NFT assets (images, metadata, and contract) on behalf of the user. We are also allowing the user to use Web3.Storage which is built on top of Filecoin as an alternative free IPFS storage service provider to backup the NFT assets. We are using Moralis IPFS for its easy use and Web3.Storage to backup the assets just in case something goes wrongs with Moralis.


## Project Status
The project is currently under development but available for anyone with an Ethereum Kovan network account to use.
